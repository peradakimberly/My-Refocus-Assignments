Hello! My name is Kimberly Perada, 25 years old. Born in February 27, 1997. I graduated Bachelor of Science in Information Technology where I studied in PUP Sto Tomas, Batangas. My previous work experience is Cage Cashier at Solaire Resort & Casino. 
My hobbies includes baking, reading, drawing, I also like cleaning and organizing stuff.
My goals this year is to focus studying web development so that I can finally feel confident with my skills and have a stable job.I also would like to establish a happy and secure home with my own family soon.
I want to be a web developer because during my college years, it is one of the topics I liked the most and I really enjoyed programming. I wasted too much years not pursuing my dream career after I graduated but this time, I am thankful that it is finally clear to me what I really want to do in my life. It's all thanks to my daughter, who changed me to be a better person. I am also thankful to my partner who supports me with my studies and helps me achieve my goals.
